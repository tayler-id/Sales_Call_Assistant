# Project Specific Rules

This file contains rules specific to the Sales Call Assistant project.

## Memory Bank

- Always maintain the core memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Create additional context files in the `memory-bank/` directory as needed for complex features, integrations, APIs, testing, or deployment.
- Review and update relevant memory bank files after significant changes or when new patterns are discovered.
- Explicitly update the memory bank when requested by the user with "update memory bank".

## Tool Usage

- Prefer using the `sequentialthinking` MCP tool for complex problem-solving and planning.
- Use the `context7` MCP server (`github.com/upstash/context7-mcp`) for retrieving documentation.
- Use `replace_in_file` for targeted code edits and `write_to_file` for creating new files or overwriting entire files.
- Always wait for user confirmation after each tool use before proceeding.
